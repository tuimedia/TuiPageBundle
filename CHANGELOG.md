# Changes

## 0.9.0

### CHANGED

* UUID ids for AbstractPage and AbstractPageData are now generated by the symfony/uid component, and `json_array` properties have been changed to `json`. You will need to generate and run a doctrine diff migration. This is to add (optional!) support for doctrine/dbal version 3. See UPGRADE-0.9.md for details.

## 0.8.15

### CHANGED

* XLIFF translation export no longer includes empty or non-string values
* XLIFF translation import now initialises the target language with a copy of the default language langData

## 0.8.14

### NEW

* Added (e.g.) `valid_languages: ['en_GB', 'fr']` parameter to the config so you can reject unexpected translations.

### CHANGED

* Downgraded some bulk indexing messages from `info` to `debug`

## 0.8.13

### FIXED

* Bump http-foundation minimum version to 4.x or 5.0.4

## 0.8.12

### CHANGED

* A new `bulk_index_threshold` config setting allows you to set the number of pages in each indexing batch. The default is now 50.

## 0.8.11

### CHANGED

* The `pages:reindex` command now performs bulk indexing of 20 pages at a time for better performance.

## 0.8.10

### CHANGED

* The XLIFF import endpoint with the destination "original" will create a new revision

## 0.8.9

### CHANGED

* Include default & available languages in page lists
* Component schema docs have been moved into this package from @tuimedia/vue-page

## 0.8.8

### FIXED

* Disabled broken cache headers & checking in PageController::retrieve
* Fixed deprecated (and then broken) SearchSubscriber argument type

## 0.8.7

### FIXED

* Fix deprecation in checkTuiPagePermissions

## 0.8.6

### FIXED

* Exceptions thrown within the SearchSubscriber are no longer fatal. Instead they're logged as errors and execution continues.

## 0.8.5

I forgot how to count, I guess. This version never existed.

## 0.8.4

### FIXED

* Implement missing `search` permission check

## 0.8.3

### NEW

* A new `access_control` configuration array contains roles to check before performing each of the write actions on the API. This works in addition to the existing advice to set up an `access_control` rule on the security component. See the README for details on how to configure this.

## 0.8.1

### FIXED

* Fixed an exception in PageSchema while trying to validate a block with no langData in the default language.

## 0.8

### BREAKING

* The data format has changed:
  * `PageData.content` has an additional integer property: `schemaVersion`. If not provided, the old format is assumed.
  * `PageData.content.layout` is now an array of block ids. Layout blocks were always another kind of block, so keeping them together makes sense and reduces the amount of code.

### NEW

* A `pages:upgrade` command to migrate content from the old format to the new. This command is repeatable without problems, so you can make it part of your deployments. BACK UP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING THIS.
